I discovered that by taking advantage of volatile CS:GO prices and the lack of price consistent updates on WTFSkins.com, it is possible to purchase skins below their market value and sell them at a higher price. After manually doing this for a few months, I decided to create a bot to automate most of the hard work for me.
